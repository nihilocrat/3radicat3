a reversed version of Missile Command made for Ludum Dare 25

Sentient life has been detected on the planet Sol III. In accordance with the Eternal Doctrine, this sentient life must be entirely eradicated to prevent possible future threat to our race, purely an act of pre-emptive defense. 

I only had a few hours to work on this, but at least I finished something! Hopefully I didn't just predict the events of next Friday, but you never know. 

Instructions: 
1, 2, 3 : fire missiles from launchers 1, 2, or 3 
Mouse pointer : aim missiles 
Left click on one of your missiles : cause it to split into two missiles. Both missiles will turn dark and will not be able to be split again.
